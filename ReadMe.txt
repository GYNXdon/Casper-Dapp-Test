Install Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. 
You can download it from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org) 
follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Install npm packages: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your code file is located. 
Run the following commands to install the required npm packages:


npm install casper-js-sdk
npm install fs
npm install axios

Generate or obtain secret key files: For the code that involves loading key pairs from private key files (./secret_key.pem)
you need to provide the corresponding key files. 
Make sure you have the private key file (secret_key.pem) available in the same directory as your code file.

Adjust NODE_ADDRESS: In the code snippets where NODE_ADDRESS is mentioned, replace it with the appropriate address of an active node on the Casper network. 
You can find active online peers for the Mainnet on cspr.live and for the Testnet on testnet.cspr.live. 
The RPC port is usually 7777, but it depends on the network's configuration settings.

Adjust recipient public key: In the transfer-related code snippets, replace <recipient-public-key> with the actual public key of the recipient's main purse. Note that the recipient's account doesn't need to exist beforehand.

Adjust sender public key: In the sendTransfer function call, replace <sender-public-key> with the actual public key of the sender's main purse.
Make sure the account associated with the sender's public key has a balance greater than 2.5 CSPR.

After completing these prerequisites, you should be able to run the code successfully. 
Remember to execute it using Node.js by running the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

node your_code_file.js

Replace your_code_file.js with the name of your code file containing the provided code.
